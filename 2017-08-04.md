- Discussed the purchase of multiple tickets
- Pointed out that each ticket gets it's own event, but a purchase command might be for many tickets
- Sketched code for handling a purchase event
- Sketched performance entity
- Went over encapsulation of operations on the entity

# For Next Time
- I (Scott) will turn the sketch code into real code
- We will start to talk about testing
