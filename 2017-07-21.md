## Topics Discussed
- TicketPurchased event
- Calculating number of tickets available based on number of purchased events
- Envisioning stream storage as a horizontal chain of events
- General admission form vs reserved seating form
- Implications of payment processing gateway and issuance of TicketPurchased event
- Aspirations for an entity name other than "Event"
- Data modeling for events vs data modeling for monolithic ORM
- Application of normalization and denormalization

## Events
- Ticket Reserved / Ticket Purchased

## Entities (and Corresponding Streams)
- Event
- Ticket

## Entity Name Alternatives
- Event
- Performance
- Course/Seminar
- Engagement

- Episode
- Scheduled (something)
- Date

## Performance
- Capacity
- Count of tickets already sold/reserved
- Count of available tickets left

## Ticket Events
- Purchased
- Reserved

## Calculating Number of Tickets Left
- Every purchase results in a Ticket Purchased event
- Every ticket is for a specific performance
- Every performance has a unique ID
- Count up the number of TicketPurchased events: Already Sold Number
- Available tickets = capacity - sold

## Stream for a Performance

performance-123

| TicketPuchased | TicketPuchased | TicketPuchased | TicketPuchased | ...

## Ticket Purchased Event
- Ticket ID
- Performance ID
- Time
- Price
- Customer ID

## Performance Entity
- Name: performance-123
- When the tickets were purchased
- How many tickets were purchased
- How many seats available (count of tickets purchased <- payment system)
- Capacity

## Payment
- Before getting a ticket purchased event, have to pay for a ticket
- Payment system (checkout)

## Notes for Next Time
- Need to work through concurrency issues of FIFO allocation of tickets to buyers
